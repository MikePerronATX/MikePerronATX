**ABOUT**
Hi, my name is Mike Perron. In May 2021, I graduated from Austin Community College with an Associate's Degree in Computer Information Technology specializing in Web Development. The core technologies of my degree are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, SQL, PL/SQL, MySQL, and Oracle Database.
In January of 2021, I started at Wipro Ltd. and began work as Software QA for Facebook and Instagram. I am currently in the process of upgrading my GitHub account and actively seeking an entry-level position as a Software Developer.
In my spare time, I play violin in the Cajun band Chansons et So√ªlards, take online Udemy courses (currently studying Selenium and Appium), and travel as much as possible with my wife.
My key strengths are that I stay focused until the job is complete, and that I love researching what I do not understand; what I lack in experience, I make up for in drive. While earning my degree, I worked as the evening manager at a Cafe on the University of Texas in Austin, and never missed a day of class. I earned straight A's in all of my classes except Java I (earned an 89.4 B), but earned the highest A in my Java II class.
Whichever company gives me my first entry-level Software Developer position will not be disappointed.
